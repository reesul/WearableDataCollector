/**
 * This class provides a set up of basic functions that the integration of any sensor must follow
 * in order to properly save their data. When creating a new service that will run forever collecting
 * their data, they extend this class and add their connection protocol with the external sensor and
 * use the provided methods to save the data into files
 *
 * The user has to define a model for the type of data that is being saved
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE FOR USAGE:
 * 1.- Any service that extends this class must be registered in the Manifest
 * 2.- Any service that extends this class must be added to the REGISTERED_SENSOR_SERVICES constant
 * 3.- Any service that extends this class must have an attribute
 *                  public static boolean isServiceRunning = false;
 *     It must be properly handled to indicate the status of the service. It should be set to true
 *     inside the mainCode method and should be set to false in the onDestroy method
 * 4.- Any service that extends this class must implement the interface ServiceStatusInterface and
 *     return the attribute isServiceRunning in the method implementation
 *
